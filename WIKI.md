# Description

TODO - 

When you have completed this code pattern, you will understand how to:

* build a simple Java application using Codewind on Eclipse
* use Tekton pipelines to deploy the Java application on OpenShift using CP4A

At the end, you will run the application with a simple interface which accepts name or latitude/longitude of the location and provides basic weather details of the location using Open Weather API.
